## Project brief:

- Dataset was taken form the Kaggle.
- **EDA, Data cleaning & Feature engineering techniques** has been applied.
- **Classification Algorithms** like Random Forest , Logistic regression, XGbosst classifier has been applied to the model

### Applied Algorithms & their Accuracy.

| Algorithm                  | Accuracy      |
| -------------              | ------------- |
| Random Forest classifeir   | 98.25%        |
| Logistic Regression        | 78.25%        |
| XGBoost classifier         | 86.25%        |

- As **RandomForest Classifer** has best accuracy compared to others so I have used in the model to build Web App.
